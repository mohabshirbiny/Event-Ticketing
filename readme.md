### Installation
---
To get developing straight away use the pre-configured Docker environment and follow the steps below.
Docker needs to be installed on your machine for this to work. Follow the Docker installation steps for your environment here https://docs.docker.com/install

### Docker dev environment installation steps
---

1. Clone the codebase from Github 

```git clone https://github.com/Attendize/Attendize```

2. Change directory to the cloned codebase

```cd Attendize```

3. Make a copy of the laravel environment file. It can be useful to set APP_DEBUG=true to help you debug any issues you might have

```cp .env.example .env```

4. Set permissions correctly on storage and public/user_content folders

```chmod -R a+w storage```
```chmod -R a+w public/user_content```

5. Run the docker-compose build command 

```docker-compose build```

6. Run composer to pull in the various dependencies for the project

```docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html/attendize attendize_composer composer install```

7. Run the Laravel generate a key for the app

```docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html/attendize attendize_php php artisan key:generate```

8. Run docker-compose up to create the development environment. You can drop the -d flag to see output from the containers which is useful for debugging. 

```docker-compose up -d```

At this point you should be able to browse to 

```http://localhost:8080```.
 
You can follow the web instructions to continue installing Attendize. If you are comfortableon the command line you can run Step 9 below. 

9. Run the command to create the various database tables

```  
docker-compose run php php artisan attendize:install
```

Attendize should now be available at `http://localhost:8080` and maildev at `http://localhost:1080`

### Enabling Dummy Payment Gateway for testing purposes ###

To be able to test the journey of buying and paying for tickets from the event page you need to have a payment gateway enabled else you can't complete the journey. To enable the dummy gateway that allows you to go through the journey
end to end change the configuration option enable_dummy_payment_gateway in ./config/attendize.php to true
```
'enable_dummy_payment_gateway'  => true
```

### Manual Installation
---
Attendize should run on most pre-configured LAMP or LEMP environments as long as certain requirements are adhered to. 

#### Requirements

##### PHP Version and Extension
PHP >= 5.5.9
OpenSSL PHP Extension
PDO PHP Extension
Mbstring PHP Extension
Tokenizer PHP Extension
Fileinfo PHP Extension
GD PHP Extension

##### MySQL
MySQL version 5.6 and 5.7 have been tested

##### Apache and Nginx
Most versions should work. Check the troubleshooting guide below for correct Nginx and Apache configurations. 

### Troubleshooting

#### If you have an old version of Attendize installed you can destroy your old environments using the commands below. Please take note that if you have a pre-existing MySQL 

#### Most problems can be fixed my making sure the following files and folders are writable:

Storage/app/
Storage/framework/
Storage/logs/
Storage/cache/
public/user_content/
bootstrap/cache/
.env
Always check the log in Storage/logs as it will likely show you what the problem is.

#### Trouble generating PDF tickets? / Checkout failing

Attendize uses Wkhtml2PDF to generate tickets. If you are getting errors while generating PDFs make sure all the driver files in vendor\nitmedia\wkhtml2pdf\src\Nitmedia\Wkhtml2pdf\lib executable.

Also make sure the setting for WKHTML2PDF_BIN_FILE is correct in the .env file. The acceptable options are:

1. wkhtmltopdf-0.12.1-OS-X.i386 - Mac OS X 10.8+ (Carbon), 
2. 32-bitwkhtmltopdf-amd64 - Linux (Debian Wheezy), 
3. 64-bit, for recent distributions (i.e. glibc 2.13 or later)
4. wkhtmltopdf-i386 - Linux (Debian Wheezy), 32-bit, for recent distributions (i.e. glibc 2.13 or later)

#### TokenMismatchException error
This error can occur when the session expires, try refreshing the page.

#### Installer not showing up?
Try navigating to your-site.com/public/. If that works and your-site.com/ doesn't, it means your server configuration needs to be updated.

##### Apache
Make sure the mod_rewrite module is enabled and the .htaccess file is being recognised.

##### Nginx
On Nginx, use the following directive in your site configuration:
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}

##### Seeing 'Maximum function nesting level of '100' reached' error?
This appears to occur when xdebug is enabled. 

Adding:
xdebug.max_nesting_level = 200
to php.ini and restarting apache should solve the issue.
